<h2>My top Three Movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Tenet</h3>
<p>It is a great movie to watch if you are a Christopher Nolan fanboy. It is one of his finest works after the movies Inception and Interstellar.
    <br> In this movie, Nolan explains a very strange concept about the possibility of time flowing backwards. This movie is a real mind boggler as some of its scenes can be pretty tricky and feel unnatural.

<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>
    This movie is still stuck in the minds of Marvel fans across the globe as the last finest work of the Rousso Bros. as it was a star studded full on action packed adventure where few scenes brought teers in the eyes of the viewers, while other scenes gave them goosebumps.<br>Definitelt a must watch...
</p>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>
    The thing about the movie 'Oppenheimer' is that it is something which a physics lover would see and feel like now he can rest in peace as he may have seen one of the greatest movie made on Science. It is yet another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan...
